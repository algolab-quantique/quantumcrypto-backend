We recommand setting up a service to maintain your django server running for production.
An exemple of service file for systemd are contained within this folder.

The bb84 service expect a python virtual environment ready with Django and Daphne installed.
The redis service expect docker to be installed.

Please inspect the exemple service files, and make adjustments as necessary

On ubutu services can be installed by dropping the service files in /etc/systemd/system/
Once the file are there, you have to enable and start the services.
    > service bb84 enable
    > service redis enable
    > service bb84 start
    > service redis start

When the code is updated on the server, you have to
    1. Activate the Python virtual environment
        > source ENV/bin/activate
    2. Do the Django migration
        > ./update-migrate.sh
    3. Restart the bb84 service
        > sudo systemctl restart bb84
